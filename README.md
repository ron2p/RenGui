## 📖 Introduction

**RenGui** is a lightweight visual novel engine designed to replace Python-based legacy engines. It separates the **Editor (Wails)** and the **Runtime (Ebitengine)**, sharing a standardized JSON data structure.

**RenGui**는 기존의 무거운 스크립트 기반 엔진을 대체하기 위해 탄생했습니다. 코딩 없이 직관적인 GUI 에디터로 시나리오를 작성하고, Go 언어의 강력한 성능으로 어디서든 실행되는 게임을 만드세요.

## ✨ Key Features

| Feature | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| ⚡ **Blazing Fast** | Built with **Go** and **Ebitengine**. Compiles to a single native binary. No heavy runtime required. |
| 🌲 **Tree-based Editor** | Visual node/tree editor using **Wails**. Drag & Drop scenarios, branches, and media. No scripting! |
| 🎬 **Cinematic** | Native support for **VP8/IVF Video Backgrounds**. Create dynamic scenes with moving backgrounds. |
| 🔊 **Rich Media** | Full support for **BGM (Looping)**, **SFX**, and **Character Sprites** (Tachie) positioning. |
| 🌐 **Web Ready** | Designed with **WebAssembly (WASM)** in mind. Run your visual novel directly in the browser. |

## 📂 Architecture
RenGui follows a Monorepo structure to keep the Editor and Engine in sync.
